"""The single audio-loading path for the whole project.

Every module that opens a `.wav` goes through `load_audio`. Having exactly
one entry point is what makes the channel and sample-rate decisions in
`docs/data_audit.md` actually hold everywhere, rather than being re-decided
(or forgotten) at each call site.

Two decisions are enforced here:

**Channels.** Five of the 1,440 files are dual-channel with bit-identical
channels (see `docs/data_audit.md` §2.2). `load_audio` always returns a 1-D
signal, downmixing by averaging. For those five files the average of two
identical channels is the original signal exactly, so this is a no-op that
loses nothing; for the other 1,435 it is already 1-D. One code path, no
special-casing, and the raw files are never modified.

**Sample rate.** Files are 48 kHz natively. The project default is 16 kHz
(`TARGET_SR`) -- Nyquist-sufficient for speech, ~3x cheaper, and the rate the
Phase 6 pretrained models require. `sr` is an explicit argument with an
explicit default precisely because `librosa.load` silently defaults to
22 050 Hz, which matches neither the source nor our target.

Nothing here is fit on data, so there is no train/test distinction to
respect. Trimming and normalisation are deliberately *not* applied here --
they are experiment axes owned by `ser/features.py` in Phase 4, not fixed
preprocessing.
