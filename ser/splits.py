"""Fold definitions — frozen once written to ``splits/folds.csv``.

This module defines the contract that makes five people's results
comparable. Once `splits/folds.csv` is committed it must never change
(CLAUDE.md rule 1); `write_folds` enforces that in code rather than leaving
it to discipline.

Protocols
---------
``speaker_independent``
    5-fold ``GroupKFold`` grouped by actor. **The primary protocol.** Every
    reported result uses this.

``random_stratified``
    5-fold ``StratifiedKFold`` on emotion. Run *only* as a deliberate
    comparison to quantify leakage — the same actors appear on both sides of
    every fold, which is exactly the flaw being measured. Never report this
    number on its own (CLAUDE.md rule 4).

``statement_holdout``
    Single split: train on statement 01, test on statement 02. Tests whether
    prosody generalises across lexical content. Note that all 24 actors
    appear on both sides, so a good score here is ambiguous between lexical
    generalisation and speaker familiarity.

``statement_holdout_si``
    The speaker-disjoint version of the above: train on statement 01 from
    training actors, test on statement 02 from held-out actors. The gap
    between this and ``statement_holdout`` isolates lexical generalisation
    from speaker memorisation.

Why folds are unequal
---------------------
24 actors over 5 folds forces fold sizes of 5,5,5,5,**4** actors
(300/300/300/300/240 clips). Because every actor has identical emotion
composition, emotion balance is automatically proportional, but gender runs
40/60 and cannot be improved: a 5-actor fold has odd parity and can never be
50/50. A hand-balanced assignment produces the same 20 pp gap. See
``docs/splits.md``.

Consequence: prefer pooled out-of-fold scoring over averaging per-fold
metrics, so the smaller fold is not over-weighted. `ser.evaluate` does this.
