"""Parse RAVDESS filenames into a DataFrame.

This module is the single source of truth for *which clips exist*. It reads
filenames and directory names only -- it never opens an audio file. Nothing
here is fit on data, so there is no train/test distinction to respect.

Filename schema in this repository
----------------------------------
The dataset as packaged here uses **five** hyphen-separated fields::

    emotion-intensity-statement-repetition-actor.wav
    e.g. data/data/Person01/06-02-01-02-01.wav

Canonical RAVDESS filenames carry seven fields, the first two being
``modality`` and ``vocal-channel``. Both are constant for the speech subset
(``03`` audio-only, ``01`` speech) and were dropped when this copy was
repackaged. `load` re-adds them as constant columns so the resulting frame
matches the canonical RAVDESS shape.

The actor is encoded twice -- as field 5 and as the ``PersonNN`` directory.
`parse_filename` checks the two agree.
